## How to generate a client with `repo-tools package schema openapi generate client`?

### Prerequisites

1. Set your OpenAPI file's `info.title` to your pluginID like so,

```yaml
info:
  # your pluginId
  title: catalog
```

2. Find or create a new plugin to house your new generated client. Currently, we do not support generating an entirely new plugin and instead just generate client files.

### Generating your client

1. Run `yarn backstage-repo-tools package schema openapi generate --client-package <directory>`. This will create a new folder in `<directory>/src/schema/openapi/generated` to house the generated content. We recommend that the client package be your plugin's common package. You should then add a new entry point into the package so that the generated content can be accessed like so, `<plugin>-common/client`. To do that, adjust your `package.json` like so,

```json
  // ... other scripts

  "exports": {
    ".": "./src/index.ts",
    "./alpha": "./src/alpha.ts",
    // highlight-add-next-line
    "./client": "./src/client.ts",
    "./package.json": "./package.json"
  },

  "typesVersions": {
    "*": {
      "alpha": [
        "src/alpha.ts"
      ],
      // highlight-start
      "client": [
        "src/client.ts"
      ],
      // highlight-end
      "package.json": [
        "package.json"
      ]
    }
  },

  // ... other stuff
```

and then create a new `src/client.ts` with the following content,

```ts name="src/client.ts"
export * from './schema/openapi/generated';
```

2. You should not need to import anything from subfolders of the `src/schema/openapi/generated` parent folder, everything you should require will be accessible from the `src/schema/openapi/generated/index.ts` file. Of note,
1. `DefaultApiClient` - this is the client that you can use to access your specific spec.
1. Any request or response types - these will be available from the index and should match the names in your spec.
